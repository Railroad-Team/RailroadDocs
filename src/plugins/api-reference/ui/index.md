# UI Components Reference

Railroad provides a set of custom UI components built on top of JavaFX. These components are designed to ensure a consistent look and feel across the application, adhere to Railroad's design guidelines, and often include built-in theming and localization support. Plugins that need to create custom user interfaces, such as for settings panes or custom dialogs, should utilize these components.

All these components are located in the `io.github.railroad.core.ui` package, with specialized localized components in `io.github.railroad.core.ui.localized`.
